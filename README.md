# VaR analysis
- Fitted RiskMetrics Model, GARCH model to forecast volatility and computed VaR
- Developed Historical Simulation to enable VaR calculation
- Implemented Filtered Historical Simulation to calculate VaR from selected data window and fitted volatility of GARCH(1,1) model
- Applied Monte Carlo simulation and GARCH model to estimate VaR term structures
